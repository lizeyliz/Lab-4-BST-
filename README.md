## Purpose
This program creates an address book of people and their contact information that can be sorted 3 ways (inorder, preorder, postorder). A user can add, delete, and modify a record providing they know the record key. The number of records (nodes) can be counted.
## Improvements
This lab is improving on the BST lab we did last quarter. Link: https://github.com/lizeyliz/6-Binary-Search-Tree.git
- Createed a version of lab in C++
- adding a text file to hold contacts with input/output
- Changed split lookupNode into printTree and lookup node methods (more accurately represents purpose)
- added more execption catching
- made user menu into method in DatabaseMethods (to clean up main)
